--

  - I will note contributions to discussion throughout the class
  
--

  - Student contributions are more important than anything I have to contribute to seminar discussion

--

### There is no ceiling for seminar marks!!

# Grade Breakdown

--

## 2. 30% - Presentation

--

- In *pairs*, you will summarize and lead a discussion on a recent neuroscience journal article. 

--

- I will return your grade & presentation feedback the week after your presentation. 

--

- Rubric is available to you online to review prior to your presentation.

# Grade Breakdown

--

## 3. 25% in-class test

- Intended to evaluate comprehension of neuroscience research techniques & approaches that were discussed during seminar. 

--

- Grades will be returned before the drop deadline (Nov 6th).

--

- No tricksy questions; will likely be heavily fill-in-the-blank.

--

- Content will come from class lectures (slides and discussion) and from the weekly assigned articles (both content and class discussion).

# Questions about grades? 

---

# Course topics

--

### Techniques-focused

--

- Most current high-level papers in neuroscience involve many complicated techniques

--

- Understanding *how* and *why* the researchers are choosing their approaches is foundational to current neuroscience

--
  + And to evaluating the author's methodological approach. 
  
--

#### Combinations of sophistocated techniques *is* current neuroscience 

--

- The goal of this course is to build a strong technical understanding of available tools

--
    + and how they can be applied to neuroscience research. 

---

# Course topics

--

- Intended to build upon one another

--

- First half of the course (up until the test - Oct 27 / Week 7), the focus will be on *output* measures in neuroscience 

--
    1. Behaviour
    
    2. Post-morterm analysis of brain tissue 
    
    3. Electrical recordings from brain cells

--

- Second half of the course will focus on more complex papers that involve combinations of techniques.
