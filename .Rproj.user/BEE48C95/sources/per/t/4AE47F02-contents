## The Importance of Behaviour to Neuroscience 

--

### **Monistic** view point: behaviour is the summated output of the underlying neural processes. 

--

*Behaviour is the summated output of the underlying neural processes.*

--

- Alterations in behavioural output represents changes in the underlying neuronal processes

--

- Most complex behaviours involve numerous component processes

---

# Lecture Overivew

### 1. Historical Perspective

### 2. Connection between Brain & Behaviour

### 3. Design and implementation of behavioural paradigms in research 

### 4. Animal behaviour as a "readout" for brain function

### 5. Tools for studying animal behaviour

---

# Historical Perspective

### The mind-body problem (aka monism vs. dualism)
    
- **Dualism**: the idea that the mind and body are separate (distinct) entities

- Aristotle (300 BCE), Plato (400 BCE), Rene Decartes (1600's)

- Rationalized that the body and the "soul" or the "mind" were clearly distinct 
    + the death of the body is separate from the existance of the soul

---

# Historical Perspective

### The mind-body problem (aka monism vs. dualism)

- The dualist perspective was challenged by the 

- **Paul Brocca** (1861) linked behavioural defects in clinical populations with brain lesion (identified during post-morterm analysis)
    + Indicated that there was localization of specific cognitive function distributed across the cortex.
    + e.g. speech perception versus speach production

---

# Historical Perspective

### Early neuroscience (1800's - 1950's) relied heavilly on behaviour. 

Clinical case studies: e.g. Phineas Gage (1848)

**Post-injury behavioural patterns** provided support for cerebral localization and information about the role of the damaged brain region (PFC).

# Historical Perspective

### Between the 1990's-recently, focus shifted towards molecular approaches.

---

# Historical Perspective

### Recent renewed interest in the study of behaviour. 

---

## Animal Behaviour as a Readout for Brain Function

- Developmental perspective 
- Lesion studies
- Necessity vs sufficiency

---

# The Connection between Brain & Behaviour

### Key issues with the reductionist persepecitve on beahvioural outputs

---

# Behavioural Paradigms in Research

### The importance of well-defined behavioural tests

#### Reliability (*does the measure produce consistent results*)

- test-retest reliability (within or between individuals)

- inter-rater reliability

#### Validity (*are you really quantifying what you think you're measuring?*)

- face validity 

- pharmacological validity

- transnational validity

---

# Hierarchical Framework of Scientific Thought

### **Theory**: A unifying scientific concept that is supported by many individual pieces of evidence. 

- Examples: Evolution, relativity. 
- Individual scientists do not generally interact directly with theories on a day-to-day basis
    + e.g. no grant proposal aims to tackle a theory. 
- Acts as the conceptual starting point for researchers. 

---

# Hierarchical Framework of Scientific Thought

### **Model**: deals with one chunk of a scientific theory

#### (1) Unifying models 

Are large, and typically fairly crystallized.

- e.g. the genetic basis of inheritance, epigenetics. 
    + Provide mechanistic insight into the overarching theory of evolution. 

#### (2) Working models

Which are typically smaller in scope and often more flexible. 

- A unifying model could encompass many working models

- e.g. Epigenetics: DNA methylation, histone modifications, histone variants.

---

# Hierarchical Framework of Scientific Thought

### **Hypothesis**: isolates one experimentall-testable aspect of a aworking model. 

- Facilitates the formation of *testable predictions* that are usually directionally-specific. 

- A hypothesis can never be "proven correct" 
    + it can only be "not disproven" 
    
- A hypothesis gains support through repeated testing of its predictions. 

- The wording of the hypothesis should lend itself well to discussion and rigorous experimental design.

- "Hypothesis driven" writing is the gold standard for research reports, grant applications and thesis projects. 

---

# Hierarchical Framework of Scientific Thought

### **Experiment**: An emperically designed series of steps designed to investigate whether the predictions will be true. 

- Involves some kind of control group.

- Either quasi-experimental or true experimental design. 
    + quasi- examples: Males versus females, clinical populations versus healthy control group. 

- Differentiation from "study" in psychology.

---

# Styles of Experiments 

#### 1. Observe: An initial observed association between two things (e.g. A, C) initiates the research design process. 

Design hypothesis: A -> B -> C 

#### 2. Measure: Confirm that A causes B

#### 3. Block: inhibiting B should prevent A from causing C

Design an experiment to prevent B while leaving the processes that cause A and C intact

#### 4. Mimic: experimentally manipulating B should prdoduce C 

Design an experiment to alter B to investigate whether this will alter the extent to which A produces C

# Behavioural Paradigms in Research

### Example: Tasks to investigate memory in the lab

Non-aversive memory measures 

- Operate on the basis that animals have a **preference for novelty**

  + Robust cross-species examples of this preference

---

# Behavioural Paradigms in Research

### Example: Tasks to investigate memory in the lab

Aversive memory measures

## Challenges and Limitations

### Variability

### Complex Nature of Animal Behavior

- Contextual considerations: generally animals are tested one at a time in novel behavioural contexts. 

- Natural complexities: very difficult to confidently identify playing versus aggressive behaviour

---

## Future Directions in animal behavioural research

#### Improvements in the quantification of behavioural data provide richer, more complex datasets.

- Much more efficient (e.g. eliminiates the need to sit scoring videos for many hours)

- Can use an exhaustive approach combined with unbiased clustering methods.

## Future Directions in animal behavioural research

### Improvements in the complexity of statistical analysis allow for richer interpreatins about behavioural patterns 

- e.g. Time-series based analyses (a concept borrowed from finance)
